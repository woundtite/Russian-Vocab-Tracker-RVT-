## Architecture Notes for Developers

### New Database Structures

#### SYNONYMS Object
```javascript
const SYNONYMS = {
    'красивый': [
        { rus: 'прекрасный', eng: 'beautiful' },
        { rus: 'красивый', eng: 'handsome' },
        { rus: 'привлекательный', eng: 'attractive' }
    ],
    // ... more entries
};
```

#### Enhanced RUSSIAN_VERBS
```javascript
{
    'идти': {
        infinitive: 'идти',
        aspect: 'imperfective',
        directionality: 'unidirectional',
        presentTense: {
            'Я': 'я иду',
            'Ты': 'ты идёшь',
            'Он/Она/Оно': 'он/она/оно идёт',
            'Мы': 'мы идём',
            'Вы': 'вы идёте',
            'Они': 'они идут'
        },
        pastTense: {
            'Я (m)': 'я шел',
            'Я (f)': 'я шла',
            'Ты (m)': 'ты шел',
            'Ты (f)': 'ты шла',
            'Он': 'он шел',
            'Она': 'она шла',
            'Оно': 'оно шло',
            'Мы': 'мы шли',
            'Вы': 'вы шли',
            'Они': 'они шли'
        },
        conjugations: { /* backward compat */ }
    }
}
```

### Key Methods Added
